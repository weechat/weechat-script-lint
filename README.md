[![Build Status](https://github.com/weechat/weechat-script-lint/workflows/CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/weechat/weechat-script-lint/actions?query=workflow%3A%22CI%22)

Weechat-script-lint is a static analysis tool for WeeChat scripts.

It can be used by people writing WeeChat scripts and it is automatically
executed in the CI of the WeeChat official scripts repository:
[https://github.com/weechat/scripts/](https://github.com/weechat/scripts/).

## Installation

The script requires Python ≥ 3.7.

In a Python virtual environment:

```
$ pip install weechat-script-lint
```

## Usage

See output of `weechat-script-lint --help`.

## Checks

When a script is checked, problems are displayed on output, with one of these
levels:

- `error`: severe problem, the script must be fixed now (the return code of
  command is the number of errors)
- `warning`: a deprecated feature is used (script may break in future) or there
  is a minor problem, the script should be fixed
- `info`: information; no urgent fix needed.

### Error: missing_email

**Issue**: the e-mail is required if the script is submitted in the official
scripts repository (error can be ignored in other cases).

**How to fix**: add a contact e-mail in the header of the script.

### Error: missing_infolist_free

**Issue**: when an infolist is asked to WeeChat with `infolist_get`, it must
always be freed by a call to `infolist_free`, otherwise this causes a memory leak.

**How to fix**: call `infolist_free` on each pointer returned by a call to
`infolist_get`.

### Error: python2_bin (Python script only)

**Issue**: the info `python2_bin` is used to find the path to Python 2.x
interpreter. Since WeeChat is compiled with Python 3 and that all scripts aim
to be compatible with Python 3, this info must not be used at all any more.
Note that some systems may not provide Python 2 at all any more.

**How to fix**: if the Python interpreter is used to run a background command,
consider using function [hook_process](https://weechat.org/files/doc/stable/weechat_plugin_api.en.html#_hook_process)
or [hook_process_hashtable](https://weechat.org/files/doc/stable/weechat_plugin_api.en.html#_hook_process_hashtable).

### Error: mixed_tabs_spaces (Python script only)

**Issue**: mixed tabs and spaces are used for indentation.

**How to fix**: replace all tabs by spaces for indentation.

### Warning: sys_exit (Python script only)

**Issue**: the function `sys.exit()` causes WeeChat to exit itself, so it
must not be used in scripts.\
This is a warning and not an error because if it is used when the import of
`weechat` fails, that means the script is not executed in WeeChat and then the
call to `sys.exit()` is harmless.

**How to fix**: if `sys.exit()` is called when the import of weechat fails,
consider setting a variable instead that will prevent the call to
`weechat.register` to be made.

### Warning: deprecated_hook_completion_get_string

**Issue**: the function `hook_completion_get_string` is deprecated and should
not be used any more since WeeChat 2.9.

**How to fix**: call the function `completion_get_string`.

### Warning: deprecated_hook_completion_list_add

**Issue**: the function `hook_completion_list_add` is deprecated and should
not be used any more since WeeChat 2.9.

**How to fix**: call the function `completion_list_add`.

### Warning: deprecated_irc_nick_color

**Issue**: the info `irc_nick_color` is deprecated and should not be used
any more since WeeChat 1.5.

**How to fix**: use the info `nick_color`.

### Warning: deprecated_irc_nick_color_name

**Issue**: the info `irc_nick_color_name` is deprecated and should not be used
any more since WeeChat 1.5.

**How to fix**: use the info `nick_color_name`.

### Warning: modifier_irc_in

**Issue**: the modifier `irc_in_xxx` sends the raw IRC message to the callback
which may not be UTF-8 valid. This is a problem in some languages like Python.

**How to fix**: use the modifier `irc_in2_xxx`. The modifier `irc_in_xxx` can
be used only if the callback operates on the raw IRC message and is prepared
to receive invalid UTF-8 data.

### Warning: signal_irc_out

**Issue**: the signal `irc_out_xxx` sends the raw IRC message to the callback
which may not be UTF-8 valid. This is a problem in some languages like Python.

**How to fix**: use the signal `irc_out1_xxx`.

### Warning: signal_irc_outtags

**Issue**: the signal `irc_outtags_xxx` sends the raw IRC message to the callback
which may not be UTF-8 valid. This is a problem in some languages like Python.

**How to fix**: use the signal `irc_out1_xxx`.

### Info: unneeded_shebang

**Issue**: the shebang is not needed, except if the script can be called
outside WeeChat, which is rare.

**How to fix**: remove the shebang, unless it is really needed.

### Info: url_weechat

**Issue**: the WeeChat site URL is not the official one.

**How to fix**: replace the URL by the official one: https://weechat.org
(`https` and no `www`).

## Example

Default output:

```
$ weechat-script-lint script.py
/path/to/script.py:44: info [url_weechat]: URL http://www.weechat.org should be changed to https://weechat.org
/path/to/script.py:45: warning [sys_exit]: sys.exit() causes WeeChat to exit itself
/path/to/script.py:98: error [python2_bin]: the info python2_bin must not be used any more
/path/to/script.py:167: error [missing_infolist_free]: missing call to infolist_free
/path/to/script.py: score = 44 / 100
Not so good: 1 scripts analyzed, 1 with issues: 2 errors, 1 warnings, 1 info
Exiting with code 2
```

Scripts grouped by score:

```
$ weechat-script-lint --score --recursive /path/to/directory
2 scripts with score 100 / 100:
  /path/to/directory/test.py
  /path/to/directory/example.py
3 scripts with score 79 / 100:
  /path/to/directory/dummy.py
  /path/to/directory/fake.py
  /path/to/directory/other.py
```
